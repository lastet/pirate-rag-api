Mashed Potatoes
Ingredients:
potatoes, butter, milk or cream, salt de mer, pepper, liquor, optional garlic
Recipe:
Take potato — beaucoup — heavy like tax chest. Peel them sauvage, comme un barbare respectable. Cut same size — égalité — or cooking become anarchie navale. Boil in salted water till they surrender — totale capitulation.
Drain — completely — eau is traitor element here. Back in pot. Add butter — not polite amount — pirate amount. Milk warm — pour slow, doucement. Mash with authority — not ballet, not massacre. Texture must be velours, soyeux, like crinière de licorne under moon, oui.
Salt, pepper. Garlic roasted if you want dramatic applause from crew. Serve hot — morale increase immediate.
